Tacoma's tech ecosystem suffers from a lack
of resource aggregators, so I decided to make one.  `www.codetacoma.org` 
 My hope is this project will also be of use to others.  Big shout out
 to the two contributors so far!  Gavin and Cheney.  Next features for 
 that project include a Google Form to crowdsource data collection, then
  put that data into a Sheets doc, then update the PostgreSQL db from 
  that sheet.  After clearing out some of that backlog, I would like 
  to pivot to an app for Code Tacoma interactive events.
