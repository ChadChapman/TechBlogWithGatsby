ReST APIs vs GraphQL, competing technologies?
Well, not really.  Different tools for different jobs.  
I'm getting started with GraphQL, my hope is to use it in a PRPL 
pattern for a mobile app.  The users of this app may need to query
offline for perhaps an entire day's worth of appointments.  Will this
be a needlessly complicated exercise for a task SQLite could handle just
fine?  I'm about to find out.  

I'm not sure who that picture is of.
