# Blog Like a Chad!
### My first "real" foray into using GraphQL.  
This project merges two starter templates from [`gatsby-blog-starter-kit`](https://github.com/DSchau/gatsby-blog-starter-kit) and [Material-UI's Dashboard starter.](https://material-ui.com/page-layout-examples/dashboard/)

Deployed with [Netlify,](https://app.netlify.com/signup) my first project with them.  So far I am really impressed, they even work with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to offer free TLS certificates.  Deploying from a repo branch is straightforward and failed builds revert back to their previous working state. (But your deploy branch should only get tested, working code right? right!?)

I promise to always use the word "musings" in any description
of this projects content.  Also, interesting.
