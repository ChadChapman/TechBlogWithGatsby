# Blog Like a Chad!
### My first "real" foray into using GraphQL.  
This project merges two starter templates from [`gatsby-blog-starter-kit`](https://github.com/DSchau/gatsby-blog-starter-kit) and [Material-UI's Dashboard starter.](https://material-ui.com/page-layout-examples/dashboard/)

Deployed on [Netlify,](https://app.netlify.com/signup) my first project with them.  So far I am really impressed, they even work with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to offer free TLS certificates.  Deploying from a repo branch is straightforward and failed builds revert back to their previous working verison. (But your deploy branch should only get tested, working code right? right!?)

The two projects use different approaches to styling, Material-UI examples are modular, GBSK opts for most components having their own separate style sheets.  I think both approaches have their place.  In the future, I'll be refactoring to use the MUI approach to keep the project consistent and because I love modular things. 

I promise to always use the word "musings" in any description
of this projects content.  Also, interesting.
